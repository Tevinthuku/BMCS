        <p>Java is 2 things</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Programming and computing platform</li>
          <li>A runtime environment</li>
        </ul>

          <br><br>
          <h3>1. A Programming and computing Platform</h3>
          <p>A lot of apps will not run unless you have java installed.
          Its a whole lot simpler to use unlike other programming lang. like C.
          It uses an object oriented model in that we must create classes and instanciate objects
          from the classes.
          <br></p>
          <h3>
2. A runtime environment</h3>

          <br> 
          This means that java can also be seen as a program/ runtime environment that
          needs to be installed on a computer in order to run java based programs.

          <br>

          <h2>

                Powers android OS</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

          <h3>Differences btwn Java and Javascript</h3>
          <br>
          Though having almost the same name, the 2 are
          quite different programming languages.
          <br>
          Java is an Object Oriented Language whereas Javascript is an intepreted language that runs in
          the browser and helps in manipulating the DOM.
          <br>
          Java On the other hand ,is used in stand alone applications,like the browser you are viewing
          this page from.
